I have uploaded all the above code in the chain branch. Whatever i have practiced till now


Through these code examples, I have learned how to use the LangChain framework to build intelligent applications powered by large language models (LLMs). I gained hands-on experience with integrating multiple LLM providers such as OpenAI, Groq, Google, Hugging Face, and Anthropic. I learned how to securely configure API keys using environment variables with dotenv.

I now understand how to create and manage prompts using PromptTemplate, and how to process responses using structured output parsers like StrOutputParser, JsonOutputParser, and PydanticOutputParser. I’ve learned to build functional chains by combining prompts, models, and parsers to automate tasks such as text summarization, report generation, question-answering, and sentiment analysis.

Additionally, I explored document loading using PDF loaders and used embedding models to perform similarity searches. This taught me how to apply LLMs to real-world data and build modular workflows.

Overall, I’ve learned the foundations of working with LangChain to create scalable, flexible AI-powered systems for both structured and unstructured text tasks. This experience has strengthened my ability to build end-to-end applications with modern LLMs.
